# MyTimeTable


Hosted using XAMPP Control Panel v3.2.2.

The python script from the /script folder is going to create a csv file with all the classes from the current semester at UBB that can be easily imported into PhpMyAdmin.

After that, the main page will display a list of options dinamically updated depending on the user's choice. In the end, after clicking the 'Show me' button a time table will be generated and displayed, which can then be easily screenshotted for future use.


Planning to add:

-Option to remove some classes(they may not be required, or the student equated them).

-Option for choosing an optional package.

-Option for reminders set for each class using the Google Calendar or something very similar.
